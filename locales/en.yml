Organiko is a project created to facilitate contact between small organic producers and consumers.<br/><br/>

We deliver baskets with ecological products in Castelldefels and Gava. Our vegetables, fruits and some other products come from the <a href="http://fruitsmontmany.es"> Montmany </a> family and their exchanges with other organic farmers. <br/><br/>

A growing project with all of our heart, to provide our two cents to the care of our mother Earth. <br/><br/> '

Every Friday you'll receive an email in which we send a form with the seasonal produce for that week. You then choose your products from that simple form. <br/><br/>

You have to send your order before midnight of the following Monday, indicating your full name, address, contact number and prefered delivery time. We make the deliveries every Thursday from 13:00 to 21:00. <br/><br/>
